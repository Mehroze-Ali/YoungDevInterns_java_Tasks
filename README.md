🚀 Learning Journey & Skills Acquired

Week 1: Java Fundamentals

- Environment Setup: Installed and configured JDK and set up VS Code with Java extensions.
- Core Syntax: Mastered variables, data types, type casting, and user input with Scanner class.
- Control Flow: Implemented conditional statements (if-else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
- Basic Programs: Developed practical applications including:
    - Even/Odd Number Checker
    - Multiplication Table Generator
    - Simple Calculator

Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures

- OOP Principles: Created classes and objects with the Car class example.
- Constructors: Implemented both default and parameterized constructors.
- Encapsulation: Practiced data hiding using private modifiers with getter/setter methods.
- Arrays: Worked with 1D and 2D arrays, implementing algorithms to find max/min values.
- String Handling: Explored String methods and created a palindrome checker.

Week 3: Advanced OOP Concepts

- Inheritance: Established parent-child class relationships between Employee and Manager.
- Polymorphism: Implemented method overriding with @Override annotation.
- Abstraction: Created abstract Shape class with concrete implementations (Circle, Rectangle).

Week 4: Exception Handling & File I/O

- Exception Handling: Used try-catch-finally blocks and created custom exceptions (InvalidAgeException).
- File Operations: Implemented reading from and writing to files using File I/O classes.


📝 How to Run the Code

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YoungDevInterns_java_Tasks.git
Navigate to any task directory and compile the Java file:

javac Filename.java
Run the compiled class:

java Filename
Note: The code was developed in VS Code but can be run from any terminal or IDE with Java support.

🌟 Reflection
This internship provided a structured path to strengthen my Java programming skills significantly. From basic syntax to advanced OOP concepts and exception handling, each week built upon the previous knowledge. The practical tasks helped me understand not just how to write code, but how to solve real problems with Java.

Completing all tasks in VS Code gave me valuable experience with a lightweight but powerful code editor and its Java ecosystem. The progression from simple programs like Hello World to implementing inheritance, polymorphism, and file operations gave me confidence in my ability to tackle complex programming challenges. This repository stands as evidence of my growth as a Java developer during this internship.
